Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9

## SOLUTION ##
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        list = []
        stack = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next
        curr = head
        while curr and curr.val == stack.pop():
            curr = curr.next
        return curr is None
