Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Example 1:
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

Example 2:
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

Example 3:
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104
s and goal consist of lowercase letters.

                    return False
                
        return len(diffs) == 2 and A[diffs[0]] == B[diffs[1]] and A[diffs[1]] == B[diffs[0]]
