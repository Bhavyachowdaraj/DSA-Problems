Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Explanation:
The strings s and t can be made identical by:
Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "f11", t = "b23"
Output: false
Explanation:
The strings s and t can not be made identical as '1' needs to be mapped to both '2' and '3'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

## SOLUTION ##
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        map_s_t = {}
        map_t_s = {}

        for sc, tc in zip(s, t):
            if sc in map_s_t and map_s_t[sc] != tc:
                return False
            if tc in map_t_s and map_t_s[tc] != sc:
                return False
            map_s_t[sc] = tc
            map_t_s[tc] = sc

        return True
